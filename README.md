## Group Peer to Peer Chat

To-do:

- [x] Peer disconnects remove the video from the session
- [x] Names for peers
- [] Shared chat for all peers
- [] Screen sharing (one per peer)
- [] Better handling of video stacking... Let's pray that we don't need to use JavaScript.
- [] Kill the session if the host leaves
- [] Better call negotiation between host and peer
